# openshell-driver-mxc

The Windows-only MXC compute driver runs each workload in a Microsoft MXC
ProcessContainer while preserving OpenShell's standard RFC 0012 runtime split:

```text
gateway / MXC driver
        |
        | gateway authentication and policy
        v
openshell-supervisor --role=isolation-backend   (host)
        |
        | generation-scoped TLS + sandbox JWT
        v
openshell-windows-sandbox                       (ProcessContainer)
        |
        v
workload
```

Caller driver config is disabled by default, so command-based MXC workflows
need explicit administrator opt-in. Host filesystem grants have no trusted
label resolver and are rejected while resource admission is enabled.
See [resource admission configuration](../../docs/how-it-works/gateways/configuration.mdx#external-resource-admission)
for the independent controls and the security consequences of opting out.

This driver implements the gateway's ordinary in-process `ComputeDriver`
contract and is linked into `openshell-gateway`. Runtime readiness comes from
the authenticated host supervisor session, not a driver-reported condition.
The resolved create-time `SandboxPolicy` is carried by
`DriverSandboxSpec.policy`. The driver provisions a one-shot ProcessContainer,
launches the Windows boundary and separate host supervisor, and monitors both.
The boundary launches the workload only after authenticated confirmation.
The driver defaults its paired runtimes to `info` logging so native workload
launches remain observable. An explicit sandbox log-level setting takes
precedence. The boundary emits structured process activity and the Windows
branch's `MXC agent launched` acknowledgement only after native spawn succeeds.

The driver resolves its gateway endpoint and TLS server-name defaults from
generic gateway inputs. The host supervisor authenticates its gateway session
and retains main-process attachment independently of the optional Unix SSH
adapter. TCP readiness remains gated by authenticated session acceptance.

Windows boundary execution is implemented by the `openshell-mxc-boundary`
library behind the dedicated `openshell-windows-sandbox.exe`. The compute driver does not
embed the supervisor, and the sandbox does not link the compute driver.
Dynamic forwarding uses the shared protocol stream, not a dedicated relay
executable or a reverse connection to a new gateway listener.

The boundary establishes its control TCP connection outward from MXC to a
generation-scoped loopback listener in the host isolation backend, matching the
Windows branch relay's connection direction. The shared transport connector
extension preserves pinned boundary TLS identity and supervisor JWT checks;
the driver neither brokers protocol requests nor runs supervision. Discovery
and attachment reuse the backend-owned listener, including reconnects. No host
firewall rule changes are required for this control path.

## Enforcement boundaries

The current port temporarily asserts main's required outer-fence guarantees
to permit Windows-branch compatibility testing. This is an unconditional
MXC-only stub, not verified enforcement evidence or production qualification.
Broad host-loopback access does not establish `NoUnmanagedEgressPath`, and
live access revocation has no verified native evidence. The provisioning TODO
tracks replacing these assertions with real enforcement. Audit metadata labels
egress as `mxc-windows-parity-unverified-egress-stub`. AppContainer identity,
authenticated transport, and generation checks remain required. Do not expose
sensitive host-local services to workloads using this compatibility path.

- MXC supplies the default-deny filesystem fence, AppContainer token, UI
  policy, and loopback-only network fence.
- `openshell-windows-sandbox` consumes its bootstrap files before launching untrusted
  code, authenticates the paired supervisor, and terminates workloads when an
  authenticated supervisor cannot recover within the reconnect deadline.
- The host supervisor owns an authenticated per-generation explicit proxy.
  Missing or cross-sandbox credentials receive HTTP 407 before policy
  evaluation. MXC denies direct Internet egress.
- The current explicit-proxy path attributes traffic to the admitted main
  workload binary. It does not distinguish descendant processes. MXC process
  policy must therefore prevent an untrusted allowed child binary from
  inheriting broader per-binary network rights.
- The loopback fence permits `127.0.0.1/32`; it does not isolate unrelated host
  services bound to that address. Treat the gateway host as trusted.
- Host supervisor tokens and descriptors live beneath an owner-only Windows
  DACL. Boundary bootstrap secrets live in the ProcessContainer staging path
  and are deleted before workload launch.

## Configuration

MXC does not implement external-resource label admission. Do not configure
`resource_admission` under its driver table; unsupported fields are rejected.
Host filesystem grants rely on workload policy and a trusted gateway operator,
not resource labels. Caller-supplied command configuration still requires
`allow_driver_config = true`. Native isolation, authenticated transport, and
outer-fence confirmation remain required.

The packaged `openshell-supervisor.exe` and `openshell-windows-sandbox.exe` default to
siblings of `openshell-gateway.exe`. Override their paths for development
builds.

```toml
[openshell.drivers.mxc]
wxc_exec_path = "C:\\mxc-kit\\bin\\wxc-exec.exe"
supervisor_binary_path = "C:\\OpenShell\\openshell-supervisor.exe"
sandbox_binary_path = "C:\\OpenShell\\openshell-windows-sandbox.exe"
# Defaults to %LOCALAPPDATA%\OpenShell\mxc.
state_dir = "C:\\Users\\operator\\AppData\\Local\\OpenShell\\mxc"
# Empty uses the gateway's loopback listener and TLS mode.
grpc_endpoint = ""
backend = "process_container"
pc_least_privilege = false
pc_capabilities = []
pc_allow_local_network = true
pc_minimal_env = false
debug = false
etw_audit = false
```

Only `process_container` supports this architecture. `isolation_session` is
rejected during sandbox validation.

Legacy configurations may retain `default_configuration_id`; it remains unused
by ProcessContainer and does not enable IsolationSession. New configurations
should omit that field.

Supply the workload command and working directory per sandbox:

```powershell
$config = '{"mxc":{"command":["C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe","/d","/c","echo hello"],"cwd":"C:\\work"}}'
openshell sandbox create --name mxc-demo --policy policy.yaml `
  --driver-config-json $config --no-tty
```

The command and working directory are required. The working directory contains
the generation-scoped bootstrap staging directory. When no generic canonical
command is supplied, the driver passes `mxc.command` to the supervisor rather
than starting a scratch workload. An explicit generic canonical command retains
precedence. Environment belongs in `--env` or `--env-from`, not gateway configuration.

When gateway TLS is enabled, configure the gateway-owned `guest_tls_ca`.
The host supervisor verifies the gateway certificate with that CA and uses
main's launch authentication bundle. Gateway client certificates and keys are
not required; driver-owned guest TLS fields are rejected.

## Capabilities

| Capability | Status |
|---|---|
| Filesystem and UI policy | Mapped to the MXC ProcessContainer fence |
| Network policy and provider credentials | Standard host supervisor proxy; proxy-aware workloads only |
| Exec, signals, retained output | Authenticated Sandbox Protocol; ConPTY resize is not yet supported |
| Dynamic forwarding | Standard supervisor `ForwardTcp` path through sandbox loopback connect |
| ETW/OCSF audit | Optional Windows Sandboxing ETW consumer |
| Gateway restart recovery | Not yet supported; live MXC generations remain in-memory |

UI controls are startup settings in the sandbox policy:

```yaml
ui:
  allow_graphical_ui: true
  clipboard: read
  allow_input_injection: false
```

Omitted UI settings deny all three capabilities. Clipboard accepts `none`,
`read`, `write`, or `all`, from the workload's perspective. Clipboard and input
injection require graphical UI. Unknown fields/values and unsupported
containment targets are rejected before provisioning. MXC advertises
`openshell.policy.ui.v1` through existing extension metadata. The gateway rejects
explicit UI policy (including `{}`) for drivers missing this capability; those
drivers need no UI-specific handling. UI policy itself does not require the
`allow_driver_config` opt-in. Recreate the sandbox to change these settings.

## Validation

### Remote Windows host

Build on a Windows MSVC development machine and run the unchanged real E2E
harness on a separate MXC host:

```powershell
.\tasks\scripts\test-mxc-remote.ps1 -HostName 172.16.178.137 -UserName test `
  -WxcExecPath 'C:\Tools\MXC\wxc-exec.exe'
```

Install the public SSH key on the target and verify its host key before running.
The script defaults to `~/.ssh/openshell-mxc-test`; override `-IdentityFile` as
needed. Both SSH and SCP must be on PATH locally. The target needs Windows
OpenSSH Server, OpenSSL on its SSH-session PATH, and a qualified MXC runtime,
but does not need Rust, MSVC, mise, or a source checkout.

The script detects native Windows architecture independently of the SSH shell,
uses the existing `windows:build:*` task, and validates the executable PE
architecture before testing. `-BuildDirectory` selects a dedicated Cargo cache.
`-SkipBuild` reuses existing artifacts without claiming they match current
sources. `-Scenario` selects an existing harness scenario.

The package includes `libz3.dll` from the target-specific Cargo build cache.
Windows prebuilt Z3 uses a dynamic runtime DLL. Supply `-Z3DllPath` if multiple
different cached versions exist or when using a custom Z3 build. The remote
host needs the native Visual C++ runtime; the runner validates DLL architecture
and gateway startup before invoking E2E.

The example gateway explicitly enables caller driver config so tests can submit
their workload command and directory. MXC does not implement external-resource
label admission. The temporary outer-fence assertions permit compatibility
testing but do not qualify exclusive network mediation or live revocation.

Uploads are cached by SHA256 and verified before execution. Each run has an
isolated remote directory under `%USERPROFILE%\openshell-mxc-tests`; old runs
are retained. Full logs, host capabilities, source status, artifact hashes, and
the results ZIP return to `target/windows-remote-results` in this checkout.
Signing-key directories are not downloaded. Test failures and incomplete
coverage remain nonzero exits. Missing host-loopback evidence is not a pass,
and a qualified host does not close the outer-fence implementation gaps above.

### Local Windows host

Run the Windows build lane on a native Windows MSVC host:

```powershell
mise run --skip-tools windows:check:x64
mise run --skip-tools windows:lint:x64
mise run --skip-tools windows:build:x64
mise run --skip-tools windows:test:mxc-real:x64
mise run --skip-tools windows:e2e:mxc
```

The real-MXC tests are skip-safe when `wxc-exec.exe` or the required host
capabilities are absent. A complete integration run still requires a qualified
Windows MXC host; cross-compilation validates code shape but cannot validate
ProcessContainer networking or DACL behavior.

The real runtime requires native ProcessContainer directional egress and ingress
host-loopback support, reported by `wxc-exec.exe --probe`. AppContainer fallback
cannot supply these guarantees. Count test-internal `SKIP` messages separately
from Cargo's passed count.

The E2E runner uses native release artifacts (override with `-BinaryDir`), OpenSSL
on PATH for disposable Ed25519 keys, and per-run writable fixtures under
`target/windows-e2e-results`. It preserves the tracked gateway TOML and isolates
CLI registration via `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`. Signing keys have an owner-only DACL,
remain outside result bundles, and are removed unless `-KeepRunning` is requested.

E2E runs real MXC only: there is no mock mode, and an inherited
`OPENSHELL_MXC_MOCK_WXC=1` is rejected. Any skipped selected scenario makes the
run incomplete and exits non-zero; a passing exit requires all selected scenarios
to execute successfully. Unit-test mocks are separate from E2E coverage.
`network-policy` checks admission and workload execution, not real network
enforcement. All-skipped real runs report `INCOMPLETE`, not `PASS`.
