# Supervisor runtime

The supervisor drives the safe isolation-backend contract and network/policy
orchestration. Its library and executable forbid unsafe code.

For a VM host supervisor, the VM driver passes its parent-liveness pipe as stdin
and sets the private `--parent-liveness-stdin` flag. A dedicated reader terminates
the supervisor when the driver closes its write endpoint or exits. The driver
protects both original pipe endpoints with close-on-exec and lets `Stdio` transfer
the read endpoint to the child's stdin. The supervisor uses the standard stdin
reader and does not adopt a numeric raw descriptor. This mode reserves stdin for
liveness; sandbox workload input travels over the boundary protocol.
