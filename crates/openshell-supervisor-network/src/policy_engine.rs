//! The authoritative policy engine for a sandbox's network decisions.
//!
//! A sandbox's policy is either YAML, enforced by [`OpaEngine`], or Cedar,
//! enforced by [`CedarOnlyEngine`]. The choice is made once at startup from
//! the policy format and never changes. [`PolicyEngine`] is the single type
//! every network decision point (CONNECT, forward proxy, policy DNS, and L7
//! relay setup) receives, so decision code cannot reach the wrong engine.
//!
//! A Cedar-sourced sandbox still owns an `OpaEngine` built from an empty
//! network policy. It serves only middleware chain resolution and per-tunnel
//! plumbing, never an authorization decision. [`PolicyEngine::tunnel_engine`]
//! is the one place the two meet: it builds the per-tunnel evaluator from
//! that plumbing engine, but pins it to the authoritative engine's
//! generation and routes its L7 decisions to Cedar.
