# openshell-mxc-boundary

Windows-only library implementing the authenticated Sandbox Protocol inside an
MXC ProcessContainer, with a thin `openshell-windows-sandbox.exe` entrypoint.
The generic `openshell-sandbox` does not link this implementation. There is no
separate supervisor-relay executable.

The Windows release lane builds this executable alongside the gateway, CLI, and
host supervisor. It accepts `--bootstrap <PATH>` and `--log-level <LEVEL>`;
bootstrap configuration remains one-use and protected by the driver. On other
platforms, runtime execution returns a clear unsupported error.

The compute driver owns provisioning, filesystem/network policy mapping, ETW,
protected bootstrap material, and monitoring the host/boundary process pair.
This library owns Windows process launch and I/O, AppContainer confirmation,
authenticated lifecycle operations, retained output, and loopback forwarding.
The separate host supervisor owns policy evaluation, provider credentials, and
upstream networking. This library does not depend on the compute driver or the
supervisor implementation.

The library also owns the host-side `MxcRuntimeBackend`, registered under the
exact admission name `openshell-mxc`, and the MXC audit schema and its validator.
Windows supervisor composition selects this backend; it delegates transport
and common lifecycle validation to the shared Sandbox Protocol implementation.
The backend keeps evidence opaque and compares validated properties with the
confirmation; its default Linux validator rejects Windows evidence.

MXC initiates the control connection to the host backend's loopback listener,
as the Windows branch relay does. The boundary remains the TLS server on that
outbound socket; the supervisor validates its pinned certificate and supplies
the authenticated Sandbox Protocol bearer. A backend-owned raw connector lets
discovery, attachment, and reconnection retain this direction without adding
MXC interpretation to shared transport or changing host firewall policy.

MXC owns separate host-launch and one-use boundary-bootstrap envelopes. Host
proxy address, authorization, and workload identity stay in the MXC launch
payload; the authenticated workload proxy URL stays in the MXC bootstrap.
Windows supervisor composition turns these into ordinary shared CONNECT
listener options. Shared isolation traits and Sandbox Protocol descriptors
contain no MXC proxy fields, and other compute drivers need no placeholders.

MXC adopts main's authenticated image-policy discovery and ordered provider
environment publication. Command-based MXC has no rootfs image policy to
discover. Publication generations prevent stale refreshes from replacing newer
credentials, independently of opaque provider revisions. Provider file delivery
is unsupported and rejected before process launch or environment replacement.
Structured shell exec intent and runtime helpers are also rejected explicitly;
they must not be silently treated as raw executable launches.

Dynamic service forwarding uses the shared protocol's `LoopbackConnect` request
and bidirectional stream. The boundary connects to the requested loopback port;
it does not launch a relay or connect back to a new gateway relay listener.
Non-loopback targets and port zero are rejected. Authentication and lifecycle
authorization precede dispatch to the forwarding operation.

This extraction preserves the current explicit-proxy network model. It does
not add transparent socket interception or a non-PSEC transport. The outer fence
still requires native ProcessContainer networking and permits all ports on
`127.0.0.1`; it is not isolation from unrelated host-loopback services.

Main requires explicit proof of no unmanaged egress path and verified
revocation. For Windows-branch parity testing, the MXC driver temporarily
asserts those guarantees without establishing them. Network audit assertions
are likewise compatibility stubs, labeled as unverified in mechanism metadata.
This does not restrict access to unrelated host-loopback services or establish
live revocation. TODOs in provisioning and confirmation track removing the
stubs; shared backend validation and native AppContainer checks remain intact.

The boundary measures its AppContainer SID from the current Windows process
token for audit identity. It rejects uncontained processes; a configured
container/profile name is not a substitute for that native token measurement.
This measurement alone does not establish network-fence guarantees.

Unit tests exercise real Windows process launch, output retention, and a real
ephemeral TCP forwarding target. These tests do not qualify MXC enforcement;
that requires the real-MXC integration and E2E lanes on a supported host.
